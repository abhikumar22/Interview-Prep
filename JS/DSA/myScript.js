// binary search (rotated sorted array search)
-> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] 
-> [4,5,6,7,1,2,3] -> need to find out elemt is present and the index
sol-> 
- need to find the pivot element (a...x...b) a nd b sholub be greater than x
- [7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6] -> mid - 2... since 2 is smaller then 7 then goto Left
- [4,5,6,7,1,2,3] -> mid - 7.. since 7 is greater than 4 then goto right
- 2 binary search, if two search return -1 then return -1
- Olog(n)+Olog(n) = 2(Olog(n)) = Olog(n)

// insertion sort
// selection sort
// bubble sort


// find missing integer in non-repeating array
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9] -> this is sorted, then check index
[5, 3, 6, 1, 8, 4, 2, 9, 7]

[5, 3, 6, 1, 8, 2, 9, 7] = 41
now 45-41=4-> anser

// Variant 2 -> [5, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 9, 7] = 
// 45 -44 = 1
//  missing and repetating integer

[1000, 5000, 2000] -> sol 1
[2, 1, 9] -> 3

traverse -> operation should be on (x< Array.length)


// two sum
[4,6,2,33,65,1] -> 35
sol:-
- sort array, ascending 
[1,2,4,6,33,65] -> 35

low=0..high=5
1+65 -> 66>35....high=high-1 = 4 (if we increse low then sum will be more greater)
same for <


// three sum


// merge 2 sorted LL or array
